# golly-maps

[![Travis](https://travis-ci.com/golly-splorts/golly-maps.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/golly-splorts/golly-maps.svg?branch=main)

Code for turning Game of Life patterns into Golly maps (ListLife arrays).

To use golly-maps, install it directly from the git repo by adding the following
to your `requirements.txt` file:

```
git+git://github.com/golly-splorts/golly-maps@develop#egg=golly_maps
```

(replace `develop` with the appropriate branch name.)

Once you have the `golly-maps` package installed into your Python environment,
you can start using it like this:

```
from golly_maps import maps

s1, s2 = maps.twocolor_randommap(100,100)
print(s1)
print(s2)
```

See maps submodule below for explanation of s1 and s2.

## Submodules

### Maps Submodule

The maps submodule is intended to turn a pattern name
into a random, unique map. For example, the "fourrabbits"
pattern will place four rabbits on the board, but the
exact placement is random each time.

```
from golly_maps import maps

s1, s2 = maps.twocolor_randommap(100,100)
print(s1)
print(s2)
```

The s1 and s2 strings are readable/usable by both
[golly-python](https://github.com/golly-splorts/golly-python)
and [golly-js](https://github.com/golly-splorts/golly-js).

This makes it useful for both the front-end Javascript Golly
simulator, and for the backend Python Golly simulator.

However, there are a limited number of maps and this is not
gneerally useful, it is primarily for use by the Golly API
and the backend simulator.

(Note: this is where new maps are added for new seasons.)

## Pattern Submodule

Like the maps submodule, the patterns submodule provides patterns
that are usable by both golly-python and golly-js. But this
submodule provides more generally useful patterns.

For example, here is how we would get a rabbit pattern and
place it in the middle of a 20 x 20 grid:

```
from golly_maps import patterns

grid = get_grid_pattern('rabbit', 20, 20, xoffset=10, yoffset=10, rotdeg=90)
url = pattern2url(grid)
print(url)
```

Dot diagrams

```
from golly_maps import patterns
print(patterns.get_patterns())
rabbit = get_pattern('rabbit', rotdeg=90)
```

# Todo

Need to fix up nomenclature - maps, patterns, pattern-mappings, it is very confusing.
